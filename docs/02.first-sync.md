# First sync using git

We now have a git repository linked with our cluster. Let's add an object in git to see it deployed in our cluster !

We'll start with an easy object, a Deployment of a "hello-word" nginx server.

We'll create the file `environments/minikube/dev/applications/hello-world/hello-world-deployment.yaml` and add a deployment in it.

```yaml
# cat environments/minikube/dev/applications/hello-world/hello-world-deployment.yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Once you have saved your file, commit it and push it in the `main` branch of your github repository :

```bash
git checkout main
git add environments/minikube/dev/applications/hello-world/hello-world-deployment.yaml
git commit -m "[minikube/dev] feat: add hello-world deployment"
git push
```

After some time (10 minutes for the default reconciliation loop), you should see the application appear in your cluster :
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n default
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-5d59d67564-9bpsw   1/1     Running   0          21m
```

You should now see the application appear in the default namespace :) 

Take a look at the structure of the `deploy` that has been created (`kubectl get deploy hello-world -n default -o yaml`):
- two labels `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/[name,namespace]` exists
- the annotation used by kubectl for manual deployments isn't present

Now, try to edit manually the deployment, for example to increase the number of replicas present : 
```bash
kubectl scale deployment --replicas 5 hello-world
```
The deployment will be scaled up until the next reconciliation, which should happen under 10m for a default installation.

If you want your manual edits to stay, you'll need to use the cli to edit the ressource and pause it by adding an annotation:

```bash
kubectl annotate deploy/nginx-deployment kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile=disabled
```

To resume the reconciliation on the ressource, you need to remove the annotation : 
```bash
kubectl annotate deploy/nginx-deployment kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile-
```

## Reduce the reconciliation loop duration

The default reconciliation loop configured in Kustomize is set to 10m. to speed things up, change it to 1m in the file `environments/minikube/dev/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml`, commit it and push it to the main branch.

```diff
# $ cat environments/minikube/dev/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml
