# Using Kustomize with flux

We've seen that to sync elements between git and the cluster, Flux was using two CRDs : `GitRepo`, and `Kustomization`.

The `Kustomization` CRD is used to do the apply of a specific path in the GitRepo; As its name suggest, it is using Kustomize to do the apply; If no `kustomization.yaml` exists at the root of the specified path, then Flux will generate one before the apply using `kustomize create --autodetect --recursive`.

What this means is you can use `kustomize` in your folders to reduce code duplication between environments.

## Example with Grafana
Let's do a simple installation of Grafana with kustomize to show you how it's done; we'll use the installation from flux directly, as it contains some useful tools from the start.

### Create the base
First, we'll create the "base" of our application : this is the common part, used on every cluster, that will be patched on each cluster depending on your needs.

We'll add the prometheus & grafana stack on the same folder, `base/applications/monitoring`

First, we add a new source pointing to the fluxv2 repositories :
```yaml
# cat /base/applications/monitoring/fluxcd-gitrepo.yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: flux-monitoring
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  interval: 30m0s
  ref:
    branch: main
  timeout: 60s
  url: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2
```

Then we add the prometheus stack :
```yaml
# cat /base/applications/monitoring/prometheus-kustomization.yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: kube-prometheus-stack
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  force: false
  interval: 1h0m0s
  path: ./manifests/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-monitoring
  timeout: 5m0s
  wait: true
```

And some useful grafana dashboards :

```yaml
# cat /base/applications/monitoring/monitoring-config-kustomization.yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: monitoring-config
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  dependsOn:
  - name: kube-prometheus-stack
  force: false
  interval: 1h0m0s
  path: ./manifests/monitoring/monitoring-config
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-monitoring
  timeout: 1m0s
  wait: true
```

And finally, let's create the `kustomization` file that will enable us to bundle this application :
```yaml
# /base/applications/monitoring/kustomization.yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
- fluxcd-gitrepo.yaml
- monitoring-config-kustomization.yaml
- prometheus-kustomization.yaml

```

The application is now ready to be deployed on the environments you want ! Let's see how we can add it on our cluster :

### Create the patches that will apply the base in your chosen environment

We've added the components in the base, but they are not yet created in your cluster as flux only monitors the `environments/minikube/dev` folder for now. We need to add a link to the base so that it is taken into account.

To do so, you'll need to create new `kustomization` files pointing to the one in the `base`; note that when a `kustomization` file is present in a folder, the other yaml files in it will be ignored by flux if they are not explicitely specified in the Kustomization file; so be careful when you're adding them to also add the existing resources in it.

```yaml
# cat /environments/minikube/dev/applications/monitoring/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
- ../../../../../base/applications/monitoring

patches: [] # define here the changes you want on this environment compared to the base
```

Once commited and pushed, you should now see the monitoring stack go up in the namespace `monitoring`.

To log in, you can use this command:
```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80
# accessible on localhost:3000 with username: admin and password: prom-operator
```
