# Let's install an UI

Flux can run without a graphical interface, but it's always good to have one for the people less familiar with Kubernetes.

This is where `Weave GitOps` comes. This is a tool developped by WeaveWorks (the original creators of Flux) which enables you to see what happens inside the cluster, and to run non-destructive flux commands on the deployed manifests.

To install this dashboard, the official recommendation is to use their `gitops` tool and to execute the command `gitops create dashboard ww-gitops --password=${PASSWORD} --export`, which will create the required flux manifests.

For more simplicity, here are the generated manifests : 
```bash
# cat environments/minikube/dev/applications/ww-gitops/bundle.yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  annotations:
    metadata.weave.works/description: This is the source location for the Weave GitOps
      Dashboard's helm chart.
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: ui
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: weave-gitops-cli
    app.kubernetes.io/name: weave-gitops-dashboard

      a simple way to get insights into your GitOps workloads.
  name: ww-gitops

    spec:
      chart: weave-gitops
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository

      username: admin

```

Install this application on your cluster, and do a port-forward on the service `flux-system/ww-gitops-weave-gitops`, port 9001. You'll then be able to access the flux's UI on localhost:9001, with the credentials `admin / admin`.

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/ww-gitops-weave-gitops -n flux-system 9001:9001
```
